Microcontroller Basic Operating System

### Minimal Operating System for Microprocessors

Just a minimal OS for microcontrollers, specifically the Raspberry Pi Pico, that makes it easier 
to run multiple programs and sensors on a single microcontroller. Running a number of apps on a single
microcontroller has become a reality now
that there is the Raspberry Pi Pico which comes with a 133 MHz CPU, 264 kB RAM and 2 MB of flash drive.
This is by far much more powerful than the original IBM PC, yet costs just $4 (well... in reality, good luck
trying to get one below $8) versus the original IBM PC which cost $1,565 (equivalent to $4,455 in 2020).

The Raspberry Pi Pico probably deserves an OS much better than this, but hey, it's a start :-)

### Main Goals

1. Allow multiple "services" to be run on a single microprocess, as defined in a .json file

2. Allow "plug and play" additions of other microprocessors, Pico and non-Pico
